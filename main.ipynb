      "\n",
      "1.  **Reagan's \"Tear Down This Wall\" Speech (June 12, 1987):** Just a couple of months after Varun's birth, U.S. President Ronald Reagan delivered his famous challenge to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin, calling for the destruction of the Berlin Wall. This became an iconic moment in the Cold War and a symbol of the eventual collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Black Monday Stock Market Crash (October 19, 1987):** A few months after Varun was born, stock markets around the world experienced a severe crash. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6% in a single day, the largest one-day percentage drop in its history. This event sent shockwaves through the global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty Signed (December 8, 1987):** Towards the end of 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev signed this landmark arms control agreement. It eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons (ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers), a significant de-escalation in the Cold War.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Iran-Contra Affair Investigations (Ongoing throughout 1986-1987):** This major political scandal in the United States, involving the Reagan administration, was heavily in the news and under investigation during 1987. It centered on the secret sale of arms to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages and the illegal diversion of funds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Glasnost and Perestroika Gaining Momentum in the Soviet Union (Throughout 1987):** While not a single event, the policies of \"openness\" (Glasnost) and \"restructuring\" (Perestroika) introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev were rapidly gaining traction and having a profound impact throughout 1987. These reforms signaled a significant shift in Soviet policy, leading to greater freedoms and eventually contributing to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n"
